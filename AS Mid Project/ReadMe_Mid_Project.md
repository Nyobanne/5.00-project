#Project: Nutrition and Environment

*Finding out the relationship between nutritional quality and environmental impact of food*

## Why
We know that the goods and services we consume generate negative externalities for the environment. This is particularly true for food.
There is increasingly more research to connect the food we eat to the environmental externalities it generates. Accessing the environmental scoring of certain foods like your average yogurt will soon become a reality.
But can you go down a level ? Is there a relationship between environmental impact and nutritional content, such as fat or caloric density?
In this analysis, we will study whether or not certain nutrients, regardless of the food, determine environmental impact.
